      How long are you waiting on the Red Line, really?

      It’s a gloomy, typical rush hour Monday morning in 2024 and you’re taking
      the Red Line from Alewife to Kendall Square, where your office is, when all
      of a sudden the train enters a slow zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the train begins to decelerate between Harvard to Central Square, you
      begin to wonder if even jumping out of the train and running would be faster
      than the the pace the train is even going at this rate.

      Many Bostonians utilize the MBTA for their daily commute to work. But over
      the years, there have been many closed routes, slow zones, and delays which
      have prevented the T from utilizing its full potential.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Which leads me to the question: <em>how long are passengers actually spending waiting
      while the T is idling at various stops?</em>
